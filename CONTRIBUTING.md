## Pull Request Checklist

- If you want to work on an issue, check if you are working on the right branch. Some issues have milestones assigned, each milestone represents a version and each version owns a branch.

- Commits shall be as small as possible, compile and pass all tests.

- Make sure your code is formatted as `rustfmt` would format it, unless `rustfmt` goes _crazy_ and dismembers everything :' )

- If you fixed a bug, add a test for that bug. Unit-Tests belong inside same file's `mod` named `tests`, integrational tests belong inside the `tests`-folder.

- Last but not least, make sure your planned pull request merges cleanly, if it does not, rebase your changes.

If you have any questions left, ask in a related issue or open a new one! : )
