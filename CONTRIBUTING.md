- If you want to work on an issue, consider working on the right branch. Some issues have milestones assigned, each milestone has branch, use that according branch.

- Commits shall be as small as possible and each commit should aim to compile and pass all tests.

- If you fixed a bug, add a test for that bug.

- Last but not least, make sure your planned pull request merges cleanly, if it does not, rebase your changes.

If you have any questions left, ask in a related issue or open a new one! : )
