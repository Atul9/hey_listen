## Pull Request Checklist

- If a pull requests breaks the current API, use the `breaking-changes`-branch, otherwise `stable-changes`.

- Commits shall be as small as possible, compile, and pass all tests.

- Make sure your code is formatted with `rustfmt` would format it, unless `rustfmt` goes _crazy_ and dismembers everything :' )

- If you fixed a bug, add a test for that bug. Unit-Tests belong inside same file's `mod` named `tests`, integrational tests belong inside the `tests`-folder.

- Last but not least, make sure your planned pull request merges cleanly, if it does not, rebase your changes.
